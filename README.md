# graph-v2-raw: graph-v2 codebase for losers

## Motivation & What is this?

I'm a loser. I failed and failed over and over again when I'm trying to learn build systems, and I'm being dead honest on that.

Normally if one knows shit about build systems, they can choose to just use CMake and steal whatever other programmers give them at the README.md, Quick Start section. But I'm using xmake and I'm like, extremely lazy and not wanting to learn Lua scripting at all.

So when I try to integrate a library into my project, I either use a system package or the worst approach possible, to `git clone` it and manually modify & adapt it into my xmake project.

So this is it. The 'rawest' form of graph-v2 codebase. All the internal `#include`s are relative. (like `#include "../../graph.hpp"`) Maybe some other minor fixes but I must have forgotten about them.

So this is just the code, and more self-contained (in a way). Use it however you want. I'll try to keep up with the updates.

## How to use?

I honestly don't know who would need this except for me, a hopeless low-IQ kid.

Actually if you can write Hello World then you should know how to use this.

Good luck. Good night.
